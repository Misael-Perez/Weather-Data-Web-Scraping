# Weather-Data-Web-Scraping

A project dedicated to learning and implementing web scraping.
I used the website timeanddate.com for New York City weather.
Website: https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/new-york
The project collected the temperature, time of day, and weather condition of New York City.
It will turn the data into a dataframe and save it into a CSV
